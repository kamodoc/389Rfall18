### Part 2 (75 pts)

*  Upon discovering the problem, I will immediately alert my boss. Let him know the severity of the problem and what the solution to the problem is. If my boss does not act immediately or does suppress my concerns. My next move will be to alert the watchdog. In doing so, I am avoiding going public with this information to hurt the company and also prevent people with bad intentions from knowing the vulnerabilities of the cars that are already on the road, in hope that behind closed doors the watchdog will pressure the company to take care of the problem immediately. Then, at this point I believe it will be in the best interest of the company to issue a statement to the public about the problem with the ECU and re-assure the consumers that they are working hard to take care of it. In my mind that’s the dream scenario and the best scenario.
   The worst scenario, Suppose I give into the demands of the company and keep quiet. Later, a person with bad intentions successfully hacks the ECU. And let’s assume a couple of cars are held hostage and some incidents are fatal. Now, it becomes a manslaughter case. 
Investigations by the FBI take effect to figure out if the company knew that their software had vulnerabilities, to be specific who in the company knew and to what extent did they know. Being the person who did the audit on the firmware, I get zeroed on and when the actual truth comes out. I am charged with manslaughter together with other individuals in the company who knew about the issues with the firmware but tried to suppress it.
